==The CoProcessors==

The MIPS archicteture defines three coprocessors (CP0, CP1 and CP2).

*Coprocessor 0* - is incorporated on CPU chip, manager of virtual memory system and handler of exceptions.
		Sometimes is AKA SCC (system control coprocessor).

*Coprocessor 1* - is reserved for the on-chip, the floating-point unit (FPU).

*Coprocessor 2* - Is reserved for future uses.

===CP0 - System Control===

Main functions (or feature)

Translate the virtual address to physical (MMU function), manages exceptions, controls cache system, error control, 
handle the change modes: *kernel, supervisor* and *user* mode.

====Registers (CP0R0 - CP0R31)====

||0 = [Index] Programmable pointer into TLB array||
||1 = [Random] Pseudorandom pointer into TLB array (read only)||
||2 = [EntryLo0] Low half of TLB entry for even virtual address (VPN)||
||3 = [EntryLo1] Low half of TLB entry for odd virtual address (VPN)||
||4 = [Context] Pointer to kernel virtual page table entry (PTE) in 32-bit addressing mode||
||5 = [PageMask] TLB Page Mask||
||6 = [Wired] Number of wired TLB entries||
||7 = [Reserved]||
||8 = [BadVAddr] Bad virtual address||
||9 = [Count] Timer Count||
||10= [EntryHi] High half of TLB entry||
||11= [Compare] Timer Compare||
||12= [SR] Status register||
||13= [Cause] Cause of last exception||
||14= [EPC] Exception Program Counter||
||15= [PRId] Processor Revision Identifier||
||16= [Config] Configuration register||
||17= [LLAddr] Load Linked Address||
||18= [WatchLo] Memory reference trap address low bits||
||19= [WatchHi] Memory reference trap address high bits||
||20= [XContext] Pointer to kernel virtual PTE table in 64-bit addressing mode||
||21â€“25= [Reserved]||
||26= [ECC] Secondary-cache error checking and correcting (ECC) and Primary parity||
||27= [CacheErr] Cache Error and Status register||
||28= [TagLo] Cache Tag register||
||29= [TagHi] Cache Tag register||
||30= [ErrorEPC] Error Exception Program Counter||
||31= [Reserved]||

====The CP0 Instructions====
DMFC0 - Doubleword Move From CP0
DMTC0 - Doubleword Move To CP0
MTC0 - Move to CP0
MFC0 - Move from CP0
TLBR - Read Indexed TLB Entry
TLBWI - Write Indexed TLB Entry
TLBWR - Write Random TLB Entry
TLBP - Probe TLB for Matching Entry
CACHE - Cache Operation
ERET - Exception Return



===CP1 - FPU===

Main functions (or feature)

Floating-point operations, follow the standard ANSI/IEEE 754-1985, uses the main cpu instructions to performs
some operations.
