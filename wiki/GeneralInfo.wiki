The PSP uses a 333 MHz MIPS R4000 (32-bit) CPU, a GPU with 2 MB onboard VRAM running 
at 166 MHz, and includes 32 MB main RAM (64 MB for PSP Slim) and 4 MB embedded DRAM.
The CPU was originally locked to run slower than the hardware was capable of and 
most games ran at 222 MHz. However, with firmware update 3.50 on May 31, 2007, 
Sony removed this limit and allowed new games to run at a full 333 MHz.
