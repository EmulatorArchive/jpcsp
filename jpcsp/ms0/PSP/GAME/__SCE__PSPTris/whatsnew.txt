What's new for PSPTris

Version 0.6 (07th of May 2006)
--------------------------------
Fixes:
	- The keyhandling are more responsive (quicker) in the game.
	- The blockhandling has been rewritten, so rotation etc. should work correct now.
	- Better handling when entering highscores (it automatically selects next position after having entered a character).
	- Updated the danzeff OSK so that it doesn't need the transperant images. This saves 1 MB of system memory. (the transperancy still works).
	- Mute the music while the game is paused.
	- Update the bricks so that there are more differences in the colors.

Features:
	- New gametype has been added (matching colors).
	- Game instructions added to the menu.
	- A line counter has been added to the classic game.
	- Exploding effect added when removing lines/balls.
	- Sounds effects has been added to the game.
