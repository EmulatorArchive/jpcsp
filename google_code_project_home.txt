jpcsp
Java psp emulator - debugger

Jpcsp

Jpcsp is the most advanced PlayStation Portable emulator, allowing you to play your PSP games on a PC.
Jpcsp has been started in July 2008 and is developed by a small but active team.

Even though Jpcsp is written in Java, it can already reach 100% PSP speed on a lot of commercial games... and the emulator performance is constantly increasing.

Jpcsp takes full advantage of dual-core processors, matching the PSP dual-core architecture. Even a quad-core can give a small performance improvement by leaving free CPU cores for the Java JIT Compiler and the graphics cache.

NVIDIA graphic cards are fully supported and Jpcsp can take advantage of powerful GPUs. Problems have been reported with ATI/AMD graphic cards: keep you Catalyst driver up-to-date as new releases might fix issues. On Windows systems, an external software renderer is available as an additional DLL. It provides the highest compatibility level and can use the CPU SIMD instructions (SSE and AVX2) for increased performance.

The project is still a beta release, but currently more than 750 games are already playable. See the list here.

Video and Audio are supported on all platforms by using Java versions of the decoders.
